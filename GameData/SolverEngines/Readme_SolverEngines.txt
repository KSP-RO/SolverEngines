Installation:
Merge the zip's GameData folder with your KSP/GameData folder. After installing, inside KSP/GameData should be a SolverEngines folder (and inside that, Icons and Plugins folders).
Note: **Unless a mod you are using requires this, do not install it. It's for developers, not end users.**

SolverEngines is at its heart a replacement paradigm for how KSP deals with engines, splitting engines into a partmodule and an engine solver. Instead of a single engine module that does everything, or that is specifically geared to a single type of enigne, and instead of needing to keep a stock engine module present but then override its values every tick, SolverEngines decouples the engine module from the code that handles performance (the solver).

SolverEngines consists of five parts: the engine module and the engine solver, a replacement for the intake module that is geared to work with SolverEngines, a GUI for various flight and engine stats, and a replacement for ModuleAnimateHeat. The engine module derives from ModuleEnignesFX (and therefore is visible to MechJeb and KER), and handles all direct KSP interaction. The solver gets input data, and exposes various public methods for the module to get information back. The intake module derives from ModuleResourceIntake.

ModuleAnimateEmissive replaces ModuleAnimateHeat with a more flexible, configurable module. It can either be linked to a part's temperature (the default) or be told what state it should be each frame (so SolverEngines can control emissive animations directly).

**NOTE**: With the exception of ModuleAnimateEmissive, SolverEngines is **not a mod for end-users**. It is a mod for developers, who should derive classes from ModuleEnginesSolver and EngineSolver (as AJE and RealFuels do). It will do nothing on its own.

To use SolverEngines, implement two classes: a class that derives from EngineSolver that handles all calculation of thrust, Isp, and fuel flow given the passed-in parameters (and any new ones necessary), and a class that derives from ModuleEnginesSolver and overrides CreateEngine() to create an engine solver of the new type (and passes it any creation stats). Also override the info methods so proper info is displayed. You may also need to override other virtual methods in ModuleEnginesSolver (like UpdateFlightConditions and UpdateThrottle) depending on your engine's need for more status information or other requirements, and methods like OnStart or OnLoad to deal with more complexity.

SolverEngines will also automatically create overheat bars if engineTemp approaches maxEngineTemp, and will set all ModuleAnimateEmissive modules on the part to solver.GetEmissive() each tick.

SolverEngines includes a GUI to display useful information about engines in flight, and additional info about air-breathing engines using SolverEngines when they are present.  The GUI will display an icon on blizzy87's toolbar if available, or on the stock toolbar if it is not.  All fields in the display GUI can be disabled in the settings window, and the display units can be changed in the units window.

See AJE or RealFuels for examplez of how to implement SolverEngines in practice.
